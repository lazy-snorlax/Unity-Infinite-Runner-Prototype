# Unity-Infinite-Runner-Prototype
A Prototype of an Infinite Runner. Using a number of 'Floor' Prefabs, recycles the floors when they are off-camera. Built for mobile games.

## What I learned
- Gameplay Mechanics behind an infinite runner, and Sonic the Hedgehog a little bit (the quick-step sections at least).
- Infinite runner cannot run infinitely in one direction in Unity (you can but the further you go the slower the processing is).

## Note:
This was only a prototype, and never developed into a full fledged game. Just me experimenting with gameplay mechanics.
